Usage Example
User: "My maize leaves are turning yellow during the dry season. What should I do?"

FarmAI: "Yellow maize leaves in dry conditions often indicate water stress or nitrogen deficiency. Here are immediate steps:

1. **Water management**: Apply mulch around plants using grass or crop residues to retain soil moisture
2. **Nutrition**: Mix ash from burned crop residues with compost - apply around plant base
3. **Timing**: Water early morning or evening to reduce evaporation
4. **Future prevention**: Consider drought-resistant maize varieties for next season

Would you like specific guidance on any of these solutions?"
